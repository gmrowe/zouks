# zouks

Zouks is a toy json parser written in Clojure. It should not be used for
anything serious. I am using it to get a better insight into parsing,
and the json file format. This project was inspired by:
[Build Your Own JSON Parser](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser).

## Requirements

- [jvm](https://jdk.java.net/22/)
